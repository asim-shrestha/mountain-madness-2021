---
Built using python, fastapi, firebase, and next,  **The Meme Machine** is inspired by Susan Blackmore's book of the same name and seeks to bring her book to life. This webapp provides a platform for users to communicate solely in memes. Users can upload a meme template or use an existing one, create a new meme, view the memes of others in real time, and respond to memes with memes.

## Tech Stack and Deployment
Our backend is coded using [fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and python 3.8. Our frontend is coded 
using [next.js](https://nextjs.org) (a React framework) and the React Bootstrap. Firebase is used to store data such as images and various python libraries are used to generate memes and also deep fry them ðŸ”¥.
